## Question: Largest Element in an Array

### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, your task is to find the largest (maximum) element present in the array.
---

### Description

You are given an array of `n` integers. You need to determine and return the element that has the highest value among all elements in the array.

This is a fundamental problem in array processing and helps build an understanding of basic traversal and comparison logic.

---

### Example

**Input:**

```
arr = [3, 17, 9, 5, 12]
```

**Output:**

```
17
```

**Explanation:**

- The largest number in the array is `17`.

---

### Constraints

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`

---

### Expected Time Complexity

- `O(N)` — where `N` is the number of elements in the array.

### Expected Space Complexity

- `O(1)` — no extra space is needed other than a variable to track the maximum.
