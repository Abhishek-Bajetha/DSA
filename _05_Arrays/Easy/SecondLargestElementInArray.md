### # Second Largest Element in an Array without Sorting

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find the second largest element without using any sorting technique or sorting library function.

You should solve this by **iterating through the array only once** or at most twice, without modifying the original array.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
arr = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
```
**Output:**
```
34
```
**Explanation:**  
The largest element is 35 and the second largest is 34.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```
arr = [10, 10, 10]
```
**Output:**
```
No second largest element
```
**Explanation:**  
All elements are the same, so there is no second largest.

## Constraints
- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`

## Expected Time Complexity
- `O(n)`

## Expected Space Complexity
- `O(1)`
