# Remove Duplicate Values from a Sorted Array

## Problem Statement

Given a **sorted array** of integers, remove all duplicate elements **in-place** such that each element appears **only once**, and return the new length of the array.

You must perform this operation **without using any extra space** (i.e., in-place). After removing duplicates, the first part of the array should contain the unique elements in the same order.

You donâ€™t need to return the modified array, just the count of unique elements. However, for clarity, the array should still be updated to reflect the removal of duplicates.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```
arr = [1, 1, 2]
```

**Output:**

```
2
```

**Explanation:**
The array after removing duplicates: `[1, 2, _]`, where `_` can be any value. The first two elements are unique.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```
arr = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
```

**Output:**

```
5
```

**Explanation:**
The array after removing duplicates: `[0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]`. First 5 elements are unique.

---

## Constraints

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= arr[i] <= 10^4`
- The array is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
