# Pattern Generation Problem

## Problem Statement

Write a Java program that generates various patterns using nested loops. The program should include multiple methods, each generating a different pattern based on an integer input `n`. The patterns should be printed to the console.

## Pattern Descriptions


### Pattern 1: Square Pattern

```
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
```

### Pattern 2: Right-Angled Triangle

```
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
```

### Pattern 3: Right-Angled Triangle with Numbers

```
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
```

### Pattern 4: Right-Angled Triangle with Same Number

```
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
```

### Pattern 5: Right-Angled Triangle with Decreasing Stars

```
* * * *
* * *
* *
*
```

### Pattern 6: Right-Angled Triangle with Decreasing Numbers

```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2
1
```

### Pattern 7: Pyramid Pattern

```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
```

### Pattern 8: Inverted Pyramid Pattern

```
*******
 *****
  ***
   *
```

### Pattern 9: Diamond Pattern

```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
 *****
  ***
   *
```

### Pattern 10: Mountain Pattern

```
*
**
***
****
***
**
*
```

### Pattern 11: Binary Pattern

```
1
0 1
1 0 1
0 1 0 1
```

### Pattern 12: Palindromic Pattern

```
1      1
12    21
123  321
12344321
```

### Pattern 13: Triangular Pattern with Incrementing Numbers

```
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
```

### Pattern 14: Right-Angled Triangle with Alphabets

```
A
AB
ABC
ABCD
```

### Pattern 15: Right-Angled Triangle with Decreasing Alphabets

```
A B C D
A B C
A B
A
```

### Pattern 16: Right-Angled Triangle with Same Alphabet

```
A
BB
CCC
DDDD
```

These examples illustrate how each pattern is generated for `n = 4`. You can test these patterns by running the corresponding methods in the Java program.
