## Question: Find the Sum of First N Natural Numbers Using Recursion

### Problem Statement

Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.
---

### Description

The function should take a number `N` as input and return the sum of the numbers from `1` to `N`, using a recursive approach.

The sum of first `N` natural numbers is:

```
sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N
```

Instead of using a formula, you must use recursion.

---

### Example

**Input:**

```
N = 5
```

**Output:**

```
15
```

**Explanation:**
The sum of the first 5 natural numbers is:

```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= N <= 10^4`

### Expected Time Complexity

- `O(N)`

### Expected Space Complexity

- `O(N)` (recursive stack)
