## Question: Reverse an Array Using Recursion

### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, write a recursive function to reverse the array in-place.

---

### Description

You are required to reverse the given array using recursion. Do **not** use any built-in reverse functions or iterative approaches.

The reversal should be done **in-place**, i.e., modify the original array without using extra space for another array.

---

### Example

**Input:**
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Output:**
```
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

**Explanation:**
The original array is reversed using recursion.

---

### Constraints

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`

---

### Expected Time Complexity

- `O(N)`

### Expected Space Complexity

- `O(N)` (recursive call stack)
