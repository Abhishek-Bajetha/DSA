## Question 2A: Print 1 to N Without Backtracking

### Problem Statement

Write a recursive function to print numbers from `1` to `N` in increasing order **without using backtracking**.

### Description

This means you should print the value before making the recursive call.

### Example

**Input:**
```
N = 5
```
**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= N <= 1000`

### Expected Time Complexity
- `O(N)`

### Expected Space Complexity
- `O(N)` (recursion stack)
