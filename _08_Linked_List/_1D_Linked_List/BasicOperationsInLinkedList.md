# Basic Operations in a Singly Linked List

## Problem Statement

Implement the following **basic operations** on a singly linked list:

1. **Creation** of a linked list from a given array of integers.
2. **Traversal** of the linked list (print all elements).
3. **Finding the length** of the linked list.
4. **Searching for an element** in the linked list (return `"Present"` or `"Not Present"`).

---

## Example

### Input:

```
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]
search value = 30
```

### Output:

```
Head node data is -> 10
10 20 30 40
Length of LL is -> 4
Present
```

## Constraints

- Array size: 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
- All elements in the array are integers.
- Search value is an integer.
