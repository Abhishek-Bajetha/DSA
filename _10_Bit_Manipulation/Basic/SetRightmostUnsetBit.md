# ✅ Set the Rightmost Unset Bit

### 🧾 Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `n`, set the **rightmost unset bit** (0) in its binary representation and return the updated number.

> Setting means: turning that 0 into 1, keeping the rest of the bits same.

### 🔍 Examples

**Input:**

```
n = 10
```

**Explanation:**
Binary of 10 = `1010`
Rightmost unset bit is at position 0 (LSB)
Set it → `1011` = **11**
**Output:**

```
11
```

---

**Input:**

```
n = 7
```

**Explanation:**
Binary = `0111`
Rightmost unset bit is at position 3 (MSB)
Set it → `1111` = **15**
**Output:**

```
15
```
