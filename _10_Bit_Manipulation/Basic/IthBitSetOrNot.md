## 🧾 Problem Statement

Write a function to check whether the **i-th bit** of a given integer `n` is **set** (`1`) or **not set** (`0`).
Bits are considered from **right to left**, **0-based indexing**.

---

## 🔍 Example 1:

**Input:**

```
n = 5, i = 0
```

**Explanation:**
Binary of 5 = `101`
0-th bit (from right) is `1`

**Output:**

```
Bit is set
```

---

## 🔍 Example 2:

**Input:**

```
n = 8, i = 2
```

**Explanation:**
Binary of 8 = `1000`
2nd bit is `0`

**Output:**

```
Bit is not set
```

---

## 🔒 Constraints:

* `0 <= n <= 10^9`
* `0 <= i <= 31`
