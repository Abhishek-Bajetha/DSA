# Set the i-th Bit of a Number

## 🧾 Problem Statement

Write a function to **set** the `i`-th bit (0-indexed from the right) of a given integer `n`.
Setting a bit means changing it to `1` **regardless of its previous value**.

---

## 🔍 Example 1:

**Input:**

```
n = 5, i = 1
```

**Explanation:**
Binary of 5 = `101`
Setting 1st bit gives: `111` → 7

**Output:**

```
7
```

---

## 🔍 Example 2:

**Input:**

```
n = 8, i = 0
```

**Explanation:**
Binary of 8 = `1000`
Setting 0th bit gives: `1001` → 9

**Output:**

```
9
```

## 🔒 Constraints:

* `0 <= n <= 10^9`
* `0 <= i <= 31`
