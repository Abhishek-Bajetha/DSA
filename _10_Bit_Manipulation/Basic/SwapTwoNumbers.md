# Swap Two Numbers Without Temp Variable (No Add/Subtract)

## Problem Statement

Write a function to **swap two integers `a` and `b`** **without using a third variable** and **without using addition (`+`) or subtraction (`-`)** operators.

You must use **bitwise operations** to solve this problem.

---

## Example 1:

**Input:**

```
a = 5, b = 9
```

**Output:**

```
After swap: a = 9, b = 5
```

---

## Example 2:

**Input:**

```
a = 10, b = 10
```

**Output:**

```
After swap: a = 10, b = 10
```

---

## Constraints:

* `-10^9 <= a, b <= 10^9`
* Don't use any extra variable
* Don't use + or -
