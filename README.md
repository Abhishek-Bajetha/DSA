# 🧠 DSA Practice in Java

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository!  
I'm consistently solving problems and tracking my progress while following the well-structured **Striver's A2Z DSA Course**. All solutions are implemented in **Java**, and each problem is documented with its description and approach.

---

## 🚀 Resources I'm Following

- 📘 [Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet (Take U Forward)](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2)
- 🎥 [Striver's A2Z DSA Course - YouTube Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgUwDviBIf0oF6QL8m22w1hIDC1vJ_BHz&si=OhgWeIW-YSFbNiTw)

These resources cover everything from the basics to advanced concepts, including arrays, strings, recursion, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and much more.

## 📁 Folder Structure

DSA/ │ ├── \_Topic_Name/ │ ├── ProblemName1.java // Java solution │ ├── ProblemName1.md // Problem description │ ├── ProblemName2.java │ ├── ProblemName2.md │ └── ... more problems │ ├── \_Another_Topic/ │ ├── Easy/ │ │ ├── ProblemName.java │ │ ├── ProblemName.md │ │ └── ... more easy problems │ ├── Medium/ │ │ ├── ProblemName.java │ │ ├── ProblemName.md │ └── Hard/ │ ├── ProblemName.java │ ├── ProblemName.md

- Each topic has a dedicated folder.
- Each problem includes:
  - A `.md` file with the **question**, **approach**, and **complexity analysis**.
  - A `.java` file with the **working solution**.

---

## 💻 Language Used

- **Java**: All problems are implemented using clean and readable Java code.

---

## 🔥 My Goal

- Stay consistent with daily problem solving.
- Strengthen my problem-solving and core programming skills.
- Build a strong foundation for coding interviews and competitive programming.

---

## 📌 Contributions

This repository is primarily for personal learning and tracking progress. However, if you'd like to contribute:

- Feel free to fork the repo and raise a pull request!
- Share your feedback and suggestions via issues.

---

## 📈 Progress Tracker (Optional)

_You can later add a tracker here with total questions solved per topic._
