# Find the Single Element in a Sorted Array

## Problem Statement

You are given a sorted array where every element appears exactly twice except for one element, which appears only once. Your task is to find and return that single element.

The solution should not use extra space and should have better than linear time complexity.

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```
arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5]
```

**Output:**

```
3
```

**Explanation:**
Every element appears twice except 3, which appears only once.

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```
arr = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]
```

**Output:**

```
2
```

## Constraints

* `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
* `arr.length` is odd
* Elements are sorted in non-decreasing order
* All elements except one appear exactly twice
