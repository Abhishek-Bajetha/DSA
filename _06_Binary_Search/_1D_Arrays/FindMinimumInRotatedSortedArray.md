# Find Minimum in a Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers that was originally sorted in increasing order but then rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Your task is to find the minimum element in this array.

Assume that the array contains **no duplicate elements**.

## Example

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```
arr = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

**Output:**

```
1
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```
arr = [11, 13, 15, 17]
```

**Output:**

```
11
```

## Constraints

* `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
* `-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`
