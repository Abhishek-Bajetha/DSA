## Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the **square root** of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer.

You must implement the solution using **binary search in O(log n)** time.
Do not use built-in functions like `Math.sqrt()`.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```
x = 4
```

**Output:**

```
2
