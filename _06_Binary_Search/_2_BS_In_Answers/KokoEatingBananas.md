## \[LeetCode 875] Koko Eating Bananas

## Problem Statement

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, where the `i-th` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will return in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her eating speed of bananas per hour, `k`. Every hour, she chooses a pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has fewer than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and does not eat from any other pile during that hour.

Return the **minimum integer k** such that Koko can eat all the bananas within `h` hours.
